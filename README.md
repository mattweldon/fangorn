# Fangorn

A set of sensible defaults for building SPAs in Elm.


## Features

  - Push-state Routing
  - Multiple Layouts


## Defaults

  - Uses Brunch as the build tool (fits in with my Elixir/Phoenix workflow).
  - SCSS as the CSS pre-processor.
  - Bootstrap 3 as the UI Framework.


## Requirements

  - Elm
  - Node / NPM


## Installation

  1. Clone this repo.
  2. Copy the files (to ensure you don't inherit the Git history).
  3. Install deps with `elm package install && npm install`.
  4. Build using `npm start`
